Changes in User Interface
=========================
This release has no changes in user interface from the previous 2.3 version.

Reiterating, both 2.3 and 3.0 supports the following features:
  	
	Receiver
    --------
	- The files will be written in this format in the default mode:
		* ASCII file header of 1024 bytes (only for EIGER detectors)
		* series of images, each preceded by a Standard Header image 
		(header described below)
	
	- Stanard Header image header in file and call back
	arguments defined. It is in the following format defined as 
	sls_detector_header defined in 
	slsReceiverSoftware/include/sls_receiver_defs.h
	Mostly 0 if not applicatble or implemented, but updated in next release 
	from firmware.
		
		* Frame Number       : 8 bytes 	# Image Number
		* Exposure Length    : 4 bytes  # sub frame number in 32 bit mode
		  		       Eiger. 
		* Packet Number      : 4 bytes	# Number of packets in an image
		* Bunch ID           : 8 bytes  # Bunch Id in beamline for jungfrau. 
		* Timestamp          : 8 bytes  # Not implemened
		* Module Id          : 2 bytes  # Not implemented
		* X Coordinate       : 2 bytes  # Id of part of detector in 1D
		* Y Coordinate       : 2 bytes  # Not implemented
		* Z Coordinate       : 2 bytes  # Not implemented
		* Debug              : 4 bytes  # Not implemented
		* Round Robin Number : 2 bytes  # Not implemented
		* Detector Type      : 1 byte   # Detector type defined by enum
				                          detectorType in slsReceiverSoftware
						                  /include/sls_receiver_defs.h
		* Header Version     : 1 byte   # 1
		
	- The call back value for Start Acquisition Call back is insignificant at the 
	moment and left for future use. Instead, the following rules apply:
		* If file write is enabled from the client, we will write the files.
		* If callbacks are registered, they will be called.
	For example, the user prefers to write the data himself, one must disable
	file write (so we dont write) and register the callbacks (so the user gets 
	the data).
		


New Features
============
	Receiver
    --------
	- One can choose the file format using the command "fileformat binary/hdf5" from 
	the client.
	
	- Virtual HDF5 file maps all the files into a single file.
	
	- Gotthard, Propix and Moench also save data in the same was as Jungfrau and Eiger
	(ie. without any packet headers, only image  header followed by image data)
	
	
	Eiger
	-----
	- The ascii part of the file (file header with acquisition parameters) moved to 
	a separate file called the master file. So one master file per acquisition.
	
	
	General
    -------
	- UDP Packets from all the detectors will contain the standard sls detector header. 
	X, Y and Z Coordinates define the position of the detector in 3d.
