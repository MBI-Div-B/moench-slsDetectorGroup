        [Jungfrau] Command line, udp_firstdst, API: getFirstUDPDestination/ 
        setFirstUDPDestination
    
    20. Command Line Parsing 
        Parsing of detector index and module index has been modified to 
        integrate round robin index.
        [detector index]-[module index]:[round robin index] [command]

        It is backwards compatible.
        For ease, one can also execute
        sls_detector_put [module index] [command]

    21. Clear Udp Destination
        Command line, udp_cleardst, API: clearUDPDestinations
        This is useful when changing receivers for a detector or for round robin
        system.

    22. Shared Memory Naming
        Shared memory name has been changed to reflect a more appropriate naming 
        scheme.

    23. [Eiger][Mythen3] Blocking trigger 
        Command line: blockingtrigger, API: sendSoftwareTrigger
        Sends software trigger signal to detector and blocks till frames are
        sent out for that trigger.

    24. [Eiger] Data stream enable for ports
        Command line: datastream, API: getDataStream/ setDataStream
        Enable or disable each port. Default: enabled

    25. Changing TCP ports
        This will only affect shared memory and will not try to change the
        current tcp port of the control/stop server in detector.

    Detector servers
    ----------------

    1.  [Gotthard2] Bad Channels moved to a new register, default settings 
        including clock frequency changed

    2.  [Gotthard2] Updated config file in detector server
    

    Virtual servers
    ----------------

    1.  Artifical pixel values increasing by every packet, instead of every pixel.

    2.  All possible features updated.


    Receiver
    --------

    1.  Frames caught in metadata
        Frames caught by the master receiver is added to master file metadata.
        Hdf5 and Binary version numbers changed to 6.3

    2.  Removed Padding option for Deactivated half modules.

    3.  Changing Receiver TCP ports
        This will only affect shared memory and will not try to change the
        current tcp port of the receiver.

    Gui
    ----

    1. [Mythen3] counters added in settings tab


2. Resolved Issues
==================

    Detector Servers
    ----------------

    1.  [Gotthard2] Tolerance in time parameters. 
        Eg. 220 ns was being set to 215 ns, instead of 222ns.

    2.  [Jungfrau] Stopping in trigger mode and then switching to auto timing mode 
        blocks data streaming from detector. Workaround fix made in 
        detector server to reset core until next firmware release.

    3.  [Jungfrau][CTB][Moench][Gotthard][Gotthard2][Mythen3] Firmware Programming
        Firmware programming incorporates more validations such as checksum of 
        program. Always ensure client and server are of same release before 
        programming firmware.

    4.  [Eiger] Stop sends last frame
        Stop acquisition will now also send out all complete frames in fifo.

    5.  [Eiger] Bottom not rotated in quad mode. Fixed.

    6.  [Mythen3] counter mask effect on vthreshold
        Setting counter mask changes vth daac values (ie. disabling sets to 2800),
        vthreshold only changes for enabled counters, setting vth overwrites
        dac even if counter disabled and when counters enabled, remembers set 
        values.
    
    7.  [Eiger] fast quad fix for loading trimbits
    
    Receiver
    --------

    1.  Disabled port or deactivated (half) modules will not create files.


- better control of what is built (PR)?
- cmake package has hardcoded path to zeromq library

    and
        https://slsdetectorgroup.github.io/devdoc/serverupgrade.html





5. Known Issues
===============

    Receiver
    --------
    1.  It does not handle readnrows or partial readout. Only the summary
        is adjusted to print in red. However, it will still write complete
        images with missing data padded. Roi will be implemented in future
        that can be complimented with this feature to remove the additional
        data in files.

    2.  Round robin is not implemented in receiver side, ie. one cannot configure
        more than 1 receiver at a time. This will/might be done in the future.
