1. Topics Concerning
====================

    - Jungfrau receiver as root user
    - Jungfrau server detector position error when switching between different detector sizes
    - Client API data call back / Gui (Eiger in 4 bit mode)
    - Receiver HDF5 printErrorStack



2. Resolved Issues
==================          

    Receiver
    --------
    
    1.  Jungfrau Receiver as root user fails to set UDP socket size to default value
        of (2000 * 1024 * 1024). It does not receive any packets afterwards.
        Temporary solution was to set it to a lower number using
            sls_detector_put rx_udpsocksize 1048576000
        This has been fixed now to allow a greater size (including the default size).
    
    2.  Fixed bug where printError was still being called once instead of printErrorStack.


    Detector Server (Jungfrau)
    --------------------------
    1.  Switching between different detector size configurations, the detector gave an
	    error "Could not set detector position". This is fixed now.

    
    Client API / Gui (Eiger)
    ------------------------
    1.  Client data call back provided the complete image data, but the number of pixels 
        in x and y was provided incorrectly at a modular level. This has been fixed to give 
        the proper value. This also fixes the Gui crashing for Eiger 4 bit mode when 
        acquiring for multiple images.
