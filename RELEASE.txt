Changes in User Interface
========================= 
	
	Receiver
	--------	
	
	1.	Bug Fix: Example receiver users code now handles child process exit
		better.	Example receiver code in slsDetectorsPackage/manual/manual-api 
		folder (mainReceiver.cpp).

	2.	detReceiver is now executed with [start tcp port] [number of receivers]
		as arguments. By default, start tcp port is 1954 and number of receivers
		is 1.
		
	User
	----
	
	3.	Added a few advanced user functions in slsDetectorUser class. 
		


New Features
============

	Detector Server
	---------------
	1.	(Eiger): Virtual class to execute on pc for integration.

	
	Client
	------
	
	2.	Parallelized more commands to detector. Beneficial for large multi detector systems.
	
	3.	One can set "threaded" to 0 in the config file and acquire from command line. It will
		not give you progress, but might be faster for large multi detector systems.
		
	
	Receiver
	--------
	
	4.	Added silent mode to receiver using command r_silent [i] from client. 
		It might be beneficial for max frame rate applications.


Resolved Issues
===============

	Gui
	---
	
	1.	Bug fix:(Eiger) In expert mode and in advanced tab, when trimbits 
		loaded are different for every pixel, the gui complains and sets 
		all trimbits to zero. This has been resolved. Now, the "Set All 
		Trimbits" field is just set to -1.
	
	2. 	Minor alignment issue in Advanced Tab fixed.
	
	Client
	------
	
	3.	Made it easier to disable the standard receiver and fixing bugs related to the use of a 
		custom one.
	
	Detector Server
	---------------
	
	4.	(Eiger): Status will return error if there was the unlikely trouble reading status 
		register in the front end board. Earlier, it would only return idle.
		
	Receiver
	--------
	
	5.	Bug fix: x, y and z coordinates in the call backs and the files 
		are still not corrected in the detector	udp header and must be 
		hardcoded for this release. It is done now.
	
	6. 	File class in receiver should be created only if file write is
		enabled. This has been corrected to that.



Known Issues
============

	Client
	------
	
	1. 	Changing file name prefix at the single detector level will not concatenate scan or 
		position variables to the file name prefix. This is now done only at the multi
		detector level. 
	

	Detector Server
	---------------
	
	2.	(Eiger) The hardware mac of the detector is used (not relayed back to the client). 
	  	For 1 GbE, the hardware IP of the detector is used (also not relayed back to the 
	  	client). 
	  	
	3.	Standard header fills x-coord in 1D. y-coord and z-coord is not implemented (3D).
	
	
	Receiver
	--------
	
	4. 	HDF5 compression and filters are not implemented yet.
