New Features
============


Resolved Issues
===============

	
	Detector Server
	---------------
	
	1.	(Eiger): x, y an z coordinates are now connected to the UDP Header.
		
	Receiver
	--------
	
	2.	x, y and z coordinates for Eiger and Jungfrau are modified to fit from the UDP Header.
	



Known Issues
============

	Client
	------
	
	1. 	Changing file name prefix at the single detector level will not concatenate scan or 
		position variables to the file name prefix. This is now done only at the multi
		detector level. 
	

	Detector Server
	---------------
	
	2.	(Eiger) The hardware mac of the detector is used (not relayed back to the client). 
	  	For 1 GbE, the hardware IP of the detector is used (also not relayed back to the 
	  	client). 
	  	
		
	Receiver
	--------
	
	3. 	HDF5 compression and filters are not implemented yet.
