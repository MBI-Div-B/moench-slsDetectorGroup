SLS Detector Package 3.1.4 released on 2018-07-25
=================================================



INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between 3.1.4 into 3.1.3 releases.


Topics Concerning
==================
	- get settings in users class
	- HDF5 in Receiver


Resolved Issues
===============

	Client
	------
	1.	Users class setSettings(-1) gave undefined settings. Has been fixed.
	
	
	Receiver
	--------
	1.	HDF5 x dimension (#images). Max made unlimited. Chunked Dataset by default.
	
	2.	When receiver gets an image more than #frames, the HDF5 dataset will 
		extend itself in the x dimension by another #frames. So, one can do
		(in Jungfrau, Gotthard, NOT Eiger)
		sls_detector_put resetframescaught 0
		sls_detector_put receiver start
		sls_detector_put status start
		sls_detector_put status start
		...
		sls_detector_put receiver stop
		
	3.	Jungfrau Single Module Master files did not link to the data file properly.
		This is fixed now.
		
	4.	Relative linking is used in the HDF5, instead of absolute now.
