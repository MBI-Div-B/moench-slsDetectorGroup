Changes in User Interface
========================= 	
	Receiver
	--------	
	1.	Bug Fix: Example receiver users code now handles child process exit
		better.	Example receiver code in slsDetectorsPackage/manual/manual-api 
		folder (mainReceiver.cpp).

	2.	detReceiver is now executed with [start tcp port] [number of receivers]
		as arguments. By default, start tcp port is 1954 and number of receivers
		is 1.
		
	User
	----
	1.	Added a few advanced user functions in slsDetectorUser class. 
		


New Features
============
	Detector Server
	---------------
	1.	(Eiger): Virtual class to execute on pc for integration.

	
	Client
	------
	1.	Parallelized more commands to detector. Beneficial for large multi detector systems.
	
	2.	One can set "threaded" to 0 in the config file and acquire from command line. It will
		not give you progress, but might be faster for large multi detector systems.


Resolved Issues
===============
	Gui
	---
	1.	(Eiger) in advanced mode: Loading trimbits and gui complains of different trimbits and
		sets all trimbits to 0. This has been resolved now.


Known Issues
============
	Client
	------
	1. 	Changing file name prefix at the single detector level will not concatenate scan or 
		position variables to the file name prefix. This is now done only at the multi
		detector level. 
	

	Server
	------
	1.	(Eiger) The hardware mac of the detector is used (not relayed back to the client). 
	  	For 1 GbE, the hardware IP of the detector is used (also not relayed back to the 
	  	client). 
	  	
	2.	Standard header fills x-coord in 1D. y-coord and z-coord is not implemented (3D).
	
	
	Receiver
	--------
	
	3. 	HDF5 compression and filters are not implemented yet.
