\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
\subsection{Motivation}\label{index_mot_sec}
Although the SLS detectors group delvelops several types of detectors (1/2D, counting/integrating etc.) it is common interest of the group to use a common platfor for data acquisition \subsection{System Architecture}\label{index_arch_sec}
The architecture of the acquisitions system is intended as follows: \begin{itemize}
\item A socket server running on the detector (or more than one in some special cases) \item C++ classes common to all detectors for client-server communication. These can be supplied to users as libraries and embedded also in acquisition systems which are not developed by the SLS\begin{Desc}
\item[See also:]\doxyref{My\-Socket\-TCP}{p.}{classMySocketTCP} \doxyref{sls\-Detector}{p.}{classslsDetector} \end{Desc}
\item the possibility of using a Qt-based graphical user interface (with eventually root analisys capabilities) \item the possibility of runnin alla commands from command line. In order to ensure a fast operation of this so called \char`\"{}text client\char`\"{} the detector parameters should not be re-initialized everytime. For this reason a shared memory block is allocated where the main detector flags and parameters are stored\begin{Desc}
