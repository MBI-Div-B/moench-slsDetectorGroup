Commands to control the acquisition


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries acquire} blocking acquisition (like calling sls\_\-detector\_\-acquire). Starts receiver and detector, writes and processes the data, stops detector. Only get!
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries data} gets all data from the detector (if any) processes them and writes them to file according to the preferences already setup (MYTHEN only). Only get!
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries frame} gets a single frame from the detector (if any) processes it and writes it to file according to the preferences already setup (MYTHEN only). Only get!
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries status} {\ttfamily returns} the detector status (string)-\/ can be: {\ttfamily running}, {\ttfamily error}, {\ttfamily transmitting}, {\ttfamily finished}, {\ttfamily waiting} or {\ttfamily idle}; {\ttfamily put} can be {\ttfamily start} or {\ttfamily stop} 
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries busy} returns {\ttfamily 1} if the acquisition is active, {\ttfamily 0} otherwise. Works when the acquisition is started in non-\/blocking mode. Only get!
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries readctr } Reads the counters from the detector memory (analog detector returning values translated into number of photons -\/ only GOTTHARD). Cannot put.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries resetctr i } Resets counter in detector, restarts acquisition if i=1(analog detector returning values translated into number of photons -\/ only GOTTHARD). Cannot put.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries resmat i } sets/resets counter bit in detector.gets the counter bit in detector ???? 
\end{DoxyItemize}
