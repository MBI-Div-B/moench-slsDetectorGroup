Commands to configure the receiver. Not used in MYTHEN.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries receiver \mbox{[}s\mbox{]}} starts/stops the receiver to listen to detector packets. Options: \mbox{[} {\ttfamily start}, {\ttfamily stop}\mbox{]}. {\ttfamily Returns} {\ttfamily }(string) status of receiver\mbox{[} {\ttfamily idle}, {\ttfamily running}\mbox{]}.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries r\_\-online \mbox{[}i\mbox{]}} sets/gets the receiver in online/offline mode. 1 is online, 0 is offline. Get is from shared memory. {\ttfamily Returns} {\ttfamily }(int)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries r\_\-checkonline} Checks the receiver if it is online/offline mode. Only get! {\ttfamily Returns} (string) \char`\"{}All online\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}\mbox{[}list of offline hostnames\mbox{]} : Not online\char`\"{}.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries framescaught} gets the number of frames caught by receiver. Average of all for multi-\/detector command. Only get! {\ttfamily Returns} {\ttfamily }(int)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries resetframescaught \mbox{[}i\mbox{]}} resets the number of frames caught to 0. i can be any number. Use this if using status start, instead of acquire (this command is included). Only put! {\ttfamily Returns} {\ttfamily }(int)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries frameindex \mbox{[}i\mbox{]}} gets the current frame index of receiver. Average of all for multi-\/detector command. Only get! {\ttfamily Returns} {\ttfamily }(int)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries r\_\-lock \mbox{[}i\mbox{]}} locks/unlocks the receiver to communicate with only this client. 1 locks, 0 unlocks. {\ttfamily Returns} {\ttfamily }(int)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries r\_\-lastclient} gets the last client communicating with the receiver. Only get! {\ttfamily Returns} {\ttfamily }(int)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries r\_\-readfreq \mbox{[}i\mbox{]}} sets/gets the stream frequency of data from receiver to client. i $>$ 0 is the nth frame being streamed. 0 sets frequency to a default timer (200ms). {\ttfamily Returns} {\ttfamily }(int)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries rx\_\-fifodepth \mbox{[}i\mbox{]}} sets/gets receiver fifo (between Listener and Writer Threads) depth to i number of frames. Can improve listener packet loss (loss due to packet processing time in Listener threads), not if limited by writing. {\ttfamily Returns} {\ttfamily }(int) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
