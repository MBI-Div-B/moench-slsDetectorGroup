Changes in User Interface
=========================
This release has no changes in user interface from the previous 2.3 version.
However, receiver data call backs have been redefined for the 
standard image header.

Reiterating, both 2.3 and 3.0 supports the following features:
  	
	Receiver
	--------
	1.	The files will be written in this format in the binary mode:
		* 1 ASCII file per measurement: header with measurement parameters
		* binary files: series of images, each preceded by a 
		  	  Standard Image Header (header described below)
	
	2. 	Standard Image Header in file and call back
	 	arguments defined. It is in the following format defined as 
	  	sls_detector_header defined in 
	 	slsReceiverSoftware/include/sls_receiver_defs.h
	 	Mostly 0 if not applicatble or implemented, but updated in next release 
	  	from firmware.
		
		* Frame Number       : 8 bytes 	# Image Number
		* Exposure Length    : 4 bytes  # Sub frame number in 32 bit mode (Eiger)
		  		       					  Real time exposre time in 100ns (Others) 
		* Packet Number      : 4 bytes	# Number of packets caught in the image
		* Bunch ID           : 8 bytes  # Bunch Id in beamline (Jungfrau) 
		* Timestamp          : 8 bytes  # Not implemened. 
										  Time stamp with 10MHz clock
		* Module Id          : 2 bytes  # Not implemented. Unique module ID.
		* X Coordinate       : 2 bytes  # Currently as Id of part of detector in 1D
										  (Future Releases) as X coordinate 
										  in complete detector system
		* Y Coordinate       : 2 bytes  # Not implemented 
										  Y coordinate in complete detector system
		* Z Coordinate       : 2 bytes  # Not implemented
										  Z coordinate in complete detector system
		* Debug              : 4 bytes  # Not implemented
										  For debugging purposes
		* Round Robin Number : 2 bytes  # Not implemented
										  Round Robin Number
		* Detector Type      : 1 byte   # Detector type defined by enum
				                          detectorType in slsReceiverSoftware
						                  /include/sls_receiver_defs.h
		* Header Version     : 1 byte   # 1.0 currently
		
	3.	The call back value for Start Acquisition Call back is insignificant at the 
	 	 moment and left for future use. Instead, the following rules apply:
		* If file write is enabled from the client, we will write the files.
		* If callbacks are registered, they will be called.
		For example, the user prefers to write the data himself, one must disable
		file write (so we dont write) and register the callbacks (so the user gets 
		the data).
		
	4.	Multiple Receivers have to be started as different processes, instead of threads
		due to static variables being used. Please refer example code provided in the 
		slsDetectorsPackage/manual/manual-api folder (mainReceiver.cpp).
		


New Features
============
	Package
	-------
	1.	One can compile using cmake or the ./cmk.sh script(also uses cmake)
	  	Run ./cmk.sh -help to get more info. This method does not touch the 
	  	source files. Please start off with ./cmk.sh -bj9, where (9 is #cores+1)
	  
	2.	One can compile the normal way using Makefile (editing Makefile.include
	  	for the hdf5 options), but this will modify other gitInfo files.
	
	
	General
	-------
	3.	UDP Packets from all the detectors will contain the standard sls detector header. 
		Jungfrau will have an extra 6 bytes preceding the standard header in the udp packets
		only. X, Y and Z Coordinates define the position of the detector in 3d. These values
		are not filled in the udp header at the moment, but will be in the files and receiver
		call backs with only x in 1d at the moment.
	  	
	4.	When acquire has started, one can use sls_detector_get busy to check the status
		of the acquire. 1 is running 0 is idle. This way one can start acqusition with &,
		poll the busy command ( or framescaught or frameindex to get status from receiver).
	  	
	  	
	Receiver
	--------
	4.	One can choose the file format using the command "fileformat binary/hdf5" from 
	  	the client, but one must compile with the options as defined in README.md
	
	5.	Virtual HDF5 file maps all the files into a single file.
	
	6.	Gotthard, Propix and Moench also save data in the same way as Jungfrau and Eiger,
	  	as described above (ie. without any packet headers, only standard image headers 
	  	for each image data)
	
	7.	(Eiger) The ascii part of the file (file header with acquisition parameters) moved to 
	  	a separate file called the master file. So one master file per acquisition.
	  
	  
   	Client
	------
	8.	(Eiger) Can now set Threshold without uploading Trimbits.
	
	9. 	(Eiger)	Setting high voltage returns -999 for only slave and on the multi level gives
		the value of the master only.
		
	10.	StartAcquisition (or sls_detector_put status start) parallelized.
	
	
	Gui
	---
	10.	Set the data streaming port (individually/ a single one that calculates for the other
	  	receiver streamer threads) via the command line
	
		
	Users-API
	-----
	11.	manual-api example forks new child processes for every extra receiver object.



Resolved Issues
===============
	Client
	------
	1.	 Memory Leak fixed when setting receiver parameters such as udp port or detector 
	  	network parameter. The signature in slsDetector.cpp and corresponding files have 
	  	changed, but does not change the slsDetectorUser API.
	  
	2.	Bug Fix: Has been made more threadsafe (strtok). Removed bug of configuring MAC 
	  	correctly even in multiple thread mode.
	  
	3.	Bug Fix: Client crashing when rx_hostname is IP instead of a hostname has been fixed.
	
	
	
	Server
	------
	4.	(Eiger/Jungfrau) Bug Fix: Client crashing should not crash the server as SIGPIPE 
	  	signal is caught.
	  
	5.	(Eiger) Bug Fix: Front End Temperature read out conversion fixed.
	
	6.	(Eiger) Bug Fix: sls_detector_get trimval(get all trimbits) would return only the first pixel 
		value. Now it returns -1 if all the pixels are different.
	  
	  
	Receiver
	--------	  
	6.	Bug Fix: Ctrl+C kills the receiver properly calling the appropriate destructors.
	
	7.	Acquire & Unblocking acquire (receiver start, status start, receiver stop) can work
	  	also when switching from gui to command line and vice versa.
	  
	8.	Bug Fix: sls_detector_get frameindex was always returning 0.
	
	9.	Bug Fix: In the rare chance that the shut down socket is still processing in 
		the genericsocket class, but the object is being deleted. 
		
	10.	(Eiger): When running independent(not slsReceiver) receiver, one needn't do receiver start
		to prepare acquisition. Prepare Acquisition has been moved to StartAcqusition and
		StartAndReadAll. 
	
	11.	(Gotthard): 639 pixels in first packet and 641 pixels in second packet. The first pixel in second 
		packet was unaccounted for. This is fixed now.



Known Issues
============
	Server
	------
	1.	(Eiger) The hardware mac of the detector is used (not relayed back to the client). 
	  	For 1 GbE, the hardware IP of the detector is used (also not relayed back to the 
	  	client). 
	  	
	2.	Standard header fills x-coord in 1D. y-coord and z-coord is not implemented (3D).
	
	
	3. HDF5 compression and filters are not implemented yet.
