1. Topics Concerning
====================

    - Jungfrau receiver as root user
    - Receiver HDF5 printErrorStack
    - Jungfrau server detector position error when switching between different detector sizes
    - Gotthard server get settings does not set default dacs anymore
    - Client API data call back / Gui (Eiger in 4 bit mode)
    - Users class added burst_trigger in getTimingMode from string
    - Gui switching to tabplot during acquisition error messages


2. Resolved Issues
==================          

    Receiver
    --------
    
    1.  Jungfrau Receiver as root user fails to set UDP socket size to default value
        of (2000 * 1024 * 1024). It does not receive any packets afterwards.
        Temporary solution was to set it to a lower number using
            sls_detector_put rx_udpsocksize 1048576000
        This has been fixed now to allow a greater size (including the default size).
    
    2.  Fixed bug where printError was still being called once instead of printErrorStack.


    Detector Server 
    ---------------
    1.  (Jungfrau)
        Switching between different detector size configurations with same detector modules, 
        the detector gave an error "Could not set detector position". This is fixed now.

    2.  (Gotthard)
        Get settings was setting the default dacs previously. It has been fixed now.

    
    Client API
    ----------
    1.  Client Callback / Gui (Eiger)
        Client data call back provided the complete image data, but the number of pixels 
        in x and y was provided incorrectly at a modular level. This has been fixed to give 
        the proper value. This also fixes the Gui crashing for Eiger 4 bit mode when 
        acquiring for multiple images.

    2.  Added "burst_trigger" in getTimingMode (from string to int) in Users class.


    Gui
    ---
    1.  Switching to Tab Plot during acquisition produced error messages. This has been 
        fixed.
